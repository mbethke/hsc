About `grafflwerk'
==================

This drawer contains some files and material that can be useful in
combination with hsc. Do with it whatever you want, use at your own
risk.

The ARexx-scripts for ScMsg are a bit experimental because I don't
like ScMsg and don't use these scripts myself.

The Arexx-script `SendBrowser' currently only supports AWeb, but
should be easy to modify for other Browsers because it is not very
complex.

hScMsg.rexx
-----------
An ARexx-script that invokes hsc redirecting it's messages and sends
messages outputed by hsc to ScMsg, which is part of the
SAS/c-package. It is supposed to be used as a substitute for hsc
inside Makefiles. See the source-code for usage.

hscPalthrow.rexx
----------------
An ARexx-script which invokes hscpitt and parses it's output, so the
user can easily access it. Refer to the documentation, section
"project management/hscpalthrow for details.

SendBrowser.rexx
----------------
An ARexx-script that can be used to display an updated html-object in
AWeb. Refer to the documentaion, section "project
management/makefiles/postprocessing" for details.

SendScMsg.rexx
--------------
An ARexx-script that sends messages outputed by hsc to ScMsg, which
is part of the SAS/c-package. See the source-code for usage.

CvtEntities
-----------
This is a primitive Perl script to convert lists of entities in SGML notation
to HSC's <$defent> syntax. If you can't figure out how to use it, you shouldn't.

vietchar.hsc
------------
Provides character entities for Vietnamese characters outside the ISO-8859-1
range. See documentation at start of file.
