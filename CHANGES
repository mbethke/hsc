Version 0.914, 6-Jun-1997
 (very minor update just fixing a few problems)

 hsc:
 - fixed bug: sgml comments at end of macros caused "unexpected
   end of context" [Hartmut Goebel]
 - fixed bug: attribute FILE of <$depend> did work just the other
   way round [Hartmut Goebel]
 - improved handling of unknown attributes: within tag calls, they
   now cause message#84 (just a warning), within macro calls, they
   cause message#85 (an error), everywhere else good old message#20
   (also an error) shows up
 - changed class of message#15 to error ("required tag missing")

 docs/
 - fixed previous/next relations between documents; buttons should
   now work
 - removed some outdated remarks on old-style macros, which could
   confuse users a lot
 - updated all next/previous relations
 - renamed `absolute URIs' to `Project Relative URIs' to avoid
   confusion as this term is normally used for `external' URIs.
 - added some notes on the not-existing german documentation
 - added some general comments about make and common problems
   (make.html)
 - added some details why hsc.prefs is used instead of DTD
   (prefs.html)

 source/
 - removed some unneeded stuff which could cause problems for some
   ridiculous compilers

 examples/
 - re-included this stuff because of popular demand

 miscellaneous:
 - compiled with gcc 2.7.2.1

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.913, 26-May-1997
 (more consitent container macros; reworked data-skipping and
 sgml-comments; improved hscpitt;some bugfixes and minor
 improvements)

 hsc:
 - fixed bug: with CLI option COMPACT enabled, empty lines at end of 
   include files have not been removed [Hartmut Goebel]
 - fixed bug: when skipping data (like when searching for a </$if>),
   hsc-comments ending with an even number of asterisks (`*') have
   not been recognised [Hartmut Goebel]
 - fixed bug: with STATUS=QUIET, even critical I/O error messages
   have been suppressed
 - fixed bug: `<$source>sepp<</$source>' did not work
 - fixed bug: message class `note' was ignored even with MODE set
   to `pedantic'
 - fixed bug: with QUOTESTYLE=NONE, values containing an underscore
   (`_') have not been quoted [Magnus Holmgren]
 - fixed bug: under certain circumstances, hsc wanted boolean
   attributes to be quoted and came up with message#81 [Magnus
   Holmgren]
 - fixed bug: with option SMARTENT set, an `&' succeeding a tag was
   replaced by `&amp;' even without any white spaces around [Stefan
   Gybas]
 - fixed some minor bugs that lead to wrong line numbers within
   messages
 - fixed some small memory leaks under certain error conditions
 - fixed a mismatched va_end() [Sergio Monesi]
 - added new concept for container macros [Walter Doerwald]
 - added CLI option SERVERDIR to support server relative URIs
 - added tag <$stripws>
 - added tag <$depend> to add dependencies to files which are not
   included directly, but also contain data which can affect the
   document [Hartmut Goebel]
 - added fExists() to check files relative to source diretory
 - added message#36 "server relative URI"
 - added message#58 "heading inside anchor"
 - added message#52 "redefined end tag"
 - moved message#55 to #50 "empty sgml-comment"
 - added message#55 "text outside sgml-comment context"
 - removed warning#56 "single word sgml-comment"
 - changed error#3 to "end of context" instead of "file", as this
   looked pretty stupid at the end of a macro in the middle of a
   file
 - changed Exists() that it now operates on URIs
 - improved skipping data:
   - whenever hsc needs to skip input until some specific tag (like
     or <$if> or <$macro>), only one procedure is called in all
     cases (less code)
   - skipping tag attributes and expressions is implemented in a
     more consistent way now
   - when skipping sgml-comments, there are still all checks
     performed
 - improved tag modifier /AUTOCLOSE: constructs like
   <P>sepp</P>hugo</P> now cause message#13, too
 - improved handling of sgml-comments; it should now handle the
   bullshit with even/odd number of hyphens (-), but you should use
   hsc-comments anyway

 hsc.prefs:
 - moved SIZE:num from tag OPTION to tag SELECT [Xavier Bestel]
 - added /required-modifier to ALT attributes; it should have been
   there since ever

 hscpitt (v1.1):

 - fixed bug: on commands DELETE and ERASE, project data have not
   been updated
 - removed some debugging output, which even showed up in optimised
   version

 source/README
 - fixed error: location of binaries was wrong
 - fixed error: hscpitt was not mentioned

 - fixed WINDOW-tooltype for some ARexx-scripts which did not set
   proper title

 - moved `Makefile' to `starter-project/source/'

 miscellaneous:
 - ported to RiscOS [Sergio Monesi and Nick Craig-Wood]
 - removed `example', added `starter-project' directory instead
 - renamed `Hmpf_Grmbl_Wrcks' to `NEWS'
 - moved hsc-sources for documentation into source-archive

---------------------------------------------------------------------
    
Version 0.912, 26-Jan-1997
 (only some bugfixes)

 hsc:
 - fixed bug: CLI option INCLUDEDIR caused some memory to be released
   twice [Rolf Herzog]
 - fixed bug: enforcer-hits when using stdout for output, and a
   PRJFILE has been specified; hsc now simple does not update the
   project file in this case, as there are no reasonable filenames
   available [Hartmut Goebel]
 - fixed bug: calling macros recursively didn't set proper
   attribute values for the end tag; hsc used the values of the later
   tag for the attributes of the ealier one [Walter Doerwald]
 - fixed bug: internal hsc-tags not beginning with an `$' haven't 
   been recognised, and hsc started to output text too soon, 
   resulting into empty lines at the beginning of output [Hartmut 
   Goebel]
 - fixed bug: same problem as above if source started with a
   macro containing empty lines in the beginning  [Hartmut  Goebel]
 - fixed bug: forgot to close some temporary files [Jens T. Berger
   Thielemann]
 - fixed bug: for missing end-tags, the position of the last 
   occurrence of the start-tag with the same name was reported as 
   corresponding start-tag
 - changed panic-messages that they now immediately abort hsc
 - added tag modifier `/RECOMMENDED' (for eg. <HTML>)
 - added CLI option --help to act same as HELP

 hsc.prefs:
 - tags <HTML>, <HEAD> and <BODY> are no more /REQUIRED, but only
   /RECOMMENDED

 source/Makefile:
 - added support for library managers (like `ar' or `oml')

 source/Makefile.dodl
 - fixed; was broken at all
 - added support to create debugging version

 documentation:
 - added some comments about panic-messages (messages.html)
 - fixed about 653246273 spelling mistakes, thanks to ISpell
   (bad grammar remains, of course)

 miscellaneous:
 - compiled with gcc 2.7.2.1 (obtained `Geek Gadgets' finally..)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.911, 4-Dec-1996 (The Porsche Release)

 and minor improvements)

 hsc:
   - fixed bug: scope rules for attribute being defined using
     <$define> did not work [Magnus Holmgren]
   - fixed bug: HSC.SOURCE.* used *.html-file, not *.hsc [Walter 
     Doerwald]
   - fixed bug that resulted into wrong URIs for SRC if ICONBASE 
     contained an asterisk ("*") [Hartmut Goebel]

     separated by a hsc- or stripped tag [Hartmut Goebel]
   - fixed bug: STRIPTAGS did not work as expected [Hartmut Goebel]
   - fixed bug that made an invokation like `hsc x/y.hsc TO x/y.html'
     result in an argument-error [Mathew Hunter]
   - fixwed bug: QUOTESTYLE=NONE removed quotes also for attributes
     with empty value, eg. ALT="" [Magnus Holmgren]
   - fixed bug (AmigaOS only) that prevented `TO=""' act the same as
     `TO ""' [Mathew Hunter]
   - changed base directory of source archive from `source/' to
     `hsc/source/'
   - changed CLI option ICONBASE that it now only works in "*"-mode
   - changed version numbering to conform with AmigaOS (using
     0.911 instead of 0.9.11)
   - added CLI option INCLUDEDIR
   - added CLI option STRIPBADWS (as suggested by Armin Obersteiner
     about 20 years ago)
   - added warning if quotes are missing from attribute 
     (message #81)
   - added environment variable HSCSALARY
   - added: version for AmigaOS can now be made resident
   - improved white spaces; now carriage return ("\r") is also
     recognised
   - improved <$exec> that REMOVE="ON" implicitly enables TEMPORARY

     more reliable
   - improved IGNORE that you now can pass a whole list of messages
     and classes to be ignored, separated by a vertical bar ("|")
   - improved HSCPATH that no more trailing slash is required
   - removed the GIF89a-bug from "known bugs" because I failed to
     create a GIF89a image that hsc can not cope with using several

 hscdepp (v1.2):
   - forgot to document some minor important CLI options: NAMEALL
     and NOTAGLINES

 hscpitt (v1.0):

   - included an example on how CLI-option GETSIZE is supposed to
     affect the output
   - added some stuff about LHA to the Q&A-chapter for non-Amigoids

 source/Makefile:
   - now supports a `make install' in Un*x environments

 miscellaneous:
   - compiled with gcc 2.7.0 and libnix 1.1 (I ought to download the
     current ADE sometimes..)
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Version 0.9.10, 30-Sep-1996
 (minor update, mostly bugfixes and code-cleanup)
 - fixed Enforcer-Hits if no project-file has been specified and
   external URIs have been referenced (reported by Jens T. Berger 
   Thielemann)
 - fixed bug that caused trashed relative URIs, if a <BASE>-tag 
   occured (reported by Andreas Gaszner)
 - fixed bug that allowed attributes of type URI being parsed
   more then once if they've been declared using <$define>,
   usually resulting into wrong paths for existence-check
   (reported by Andreas Gaszner)
 - fixed bug that caused the relative destination-dir to be omitted
   for the output-filename, if a full input-filename has been passed
   (reported by Walter Doerwald)
 - fixed a minor bug in grafflwerk/hScMsg.rexx, which could lead to
   a wrong return-code if ScMsg had to be invoked from the script
 - stopped supporting plain 68000 CPUs; now at least a 68020 is
   required for hsc and hscdepp
 - added CLI option DEFINE
 - added CLI-option MSGANSI
 - added CLI-option PREFSFILE
 - added CLI-option QUOTESTYLE
 - improved id-checking that it now also works if current document
   is referenced indirectly via it's own filename.
 - improved handling of input-files (speed increase for files >100k)
 - improved code-sharing for hscdepp (smaller executable)
 - improved help; it now also shows argument-type and -flags
 - cleaned-up "Makefile.dodl" so that it only contains the
   dependencies really required.
 - compiled with gcc 2.7.0 and libnix 1.1

Version 0.9.9,  9-Aug-1996
 - fixed bug: option RPLCENT didn't work as expected due to a
   strange behavior of GCC's isalpha(), which declared eg. `ü' as an
   alphanumeric char (only AmigaOS; reported by Stefan Gybas)
 - fixed bug: absolute URIs lead to wrong URIs, if they exceeded two
   nested directories (reported by Stefan Gybas)
 - fixed some minor bugs that prevented you from oppressing certain
   messages (reported by Armin Obersteiner)
 - fixed bug: for Amiga-version, there has been no reasonable way to
   specify the current directory as destination-dir; now you can use
   the usual (strange) `TO ""'
 - fixed bug: for required attributes missing, the parser had some
   (minor) problems to recover and skipped everything until the next
   `>'. In the worst case, this could lead to an `unexpected
   end-of-file'
 - fixed a bug that lead to infinite loop when trying to set the
   value of a numeric attribute (somehow reported by Marcel
   Offermans)
 - fixed some minor bugs
 - renamed all special attributes; instead of eg. `__ANCHOR__' you
   now have to use `HSC.ANCHOR'
 - improved some internal string-functions (speed increase)
 - improved creation of output-string: hsc doesn't any more create
   one single (huge) output-string, but maintains a list of strings
   which are concatenated to a file. This improves performance for
   huge input-files and also fixes a problem with the
   malloc()-function of libnix (unreasonable high memory usage)
 - improved handling for unknown tags; expressions are now processed
   for their attributes, too.
 - improved handling of Error 64 (illegal attribute identifier); now
   the parser immediatly stops processing attributes
 - improved <$exec> to include output immediatly or store it in an
   attribute
 - improved CLI-option ICONBASE to replace an asterisk ("*") by the
   name of the icon-entity
 - added CLI-option RPLCQUOTE
 - added CLI-option EXTENSION
 - added attribute HSC.EXEC.RESULT
 - added attribute HSC.FORMAT.FILESIZE
 - added attribute HSC.LF
 - added attribute HSC.FORMAT.TIME
 - added function GetFileSize("filename")
 - added functions GetTime() and GetGmTime()
 - added loads of silly quotes to the docs
 - added "grafflwerk"-drawer to archive
 - added simple ARexx-Scripts to communicate with ScMsg and AWeb
 - now using dullest icons ever for the executables
 - played around a bit with compiler-flags, resulting in a smaller
   executable
 - included a 68020-compiled version for AmigaOS
 - compiled with gcc 2.7.0 and libnix 1.1

Version 0.9.8, 29-May-1996
 (reads rather embarrasing this time)
 - fixed hsc's most distressing bug (so far): when setting
   `TO=dir/', for URI-checking, under certain circumstances (better:
   nearly always), another `/' has been appended to the destination
   path (reported first by Jörg Plate)
 - fixed bug that caused URIs to be checked in source-path if
   `TO=xy' didn't end with `/' (which specified a file explicitely)
   (reported by Stefan Gybas)
 - fixed bug: GETSIZE for transparent GIFs didn't set correct size
   (reported by Neil Bothwick). Actually, hsc couldn't handle
   GIF89a-extensions at all.
 - fixed bug that could lead to wrong message position when
   inserting expressions with `<(expr)>'; now, only the position
   where the `)>' has appeared is used
 - fixed bug that lead to wrong message position for messages
   launched during scan of string-constants (always used start of
   string as position)
 - fixed bug: URIs like `:../parent.html' are now handled correctly
 - fixed bug: `.' has been handled as word-delimiter
 - fixed bug: for tags that had the /SKIPLF switch set, immediately
   following white-spaces have been stripped
 - fixed bug: errors in CLI-args didn't set a proper returncode;
   requesting help or license now sets a warning-returncode
 - fixed some minor bugs in check for inconsistencies within
   <$DEFENT>
 - fixed a minor bug that suppressed white-spaces in tag-calls
   immediatly preceeding a linefeed
 - fixed some typos and missing attribute in hsc.prefs (reported by
   Marcel Offermans)
 - added "location of previous call"-messages if a message is
   launched during processing a macro or an include-file
 - added tag <$DEFICON> to define icon-entity
 - added CLI-option ICONBASE to denote a base-uri where icon images
   are located and replace all icon-entities with <IMG>-tags
 - added global attribute __COLOR_NAMES__ to declare color constants
   to be used with attribute-type `COLOR'
 - added several global attributes to get path and name of
   destination-uri/source-file: __DEST_PATH__, __DEST_NAME_ and
   __DEST_URI__ respectively __SOURCE_NAME__, __SOURCE_PATH and
   __SOURCE_FILE__ (as suggested by several people)
 - added special attribute __ANCHOR__ to contain last anchor referend
   to
 - added messages #78 and  #79, which whine about
   preceding/succeeding white-spaces on some containers; I didn't
   count these style-lacks in hsc's own docs.. (now fixed, of
   course)
 - added support for server-relativ URIs (starting with a `/'); they
   are now handled like external URIs and can't be checked for
   existence
 - added placeholder `%n' in MSGFORMAT for linefeed
 - allowed tags to be redefined by macros
 - added hsc-logo on mainpage of docs
 - increased buffer for status messages to 160 chars
 - compiled with gcc 2.7.0 and libnix 1.1

Version 0.9.7, 15-May-1996
 - fixed a nasty bug that could cause enforcer-hits inside macros
 - fixed bug: for GETSIZE within GIFs, now the size of the first
   image is used (before: size of screen)
 - MAJOR CHANGE:
   - changed CLI option TO that it requires keyword `TO'
     and decides if TO decribes a directory or file
     depending on the last character (check for `/').
   - removed CLI option INCLUDE; now you have to pass
     only the filename with no preceeding keyword
   - declaration of an enumerator-type now supports
     expressions as argument.
 - renamed CLI option ERRFILE to MSGFILE ('cause not all messages
   are errors..)
 - removed CLI option CHECKURI; now use IGNORE=21 if you don't want
   your URIs to be checked for existence
 - added CLI option MSGFORMAT to describe output format of messages
 - added useful file location for messages within macros
 - changed message for missing end tags that it now reports location
   of corresponding start tag
 - added check for existence of IDs inside same file
 - added CLI option PRJFILE for project-file that maintains data
   about IDs globaly
 - added check for existence of IDs inside same file
 - added check for existence of IDs for all files included into
   project-file
 - added attribute types `ID' and `COLOR'
 - added tag "<(..)>" to insert values of expressions
 - added JFIF/JPEG-support for GETSIZE
 - added support for some html3-tags within "hsc.prefs"
 - added new message type "portability problem"
 - added def's for most proposed html30-tags
 - removed string-arrays for parsing & checking URIs; there should
   be no more "normal" C-strings within the whole source now (exept
   some message buffers, which get truncated if too small)
 - now compiles fine with gcc's "-Wall -W"-options (exept some
   warnings about unused variables/functions)
 - using that stupid AmigaGuide-like buttons for the navigation bar
   within the docs

Version 0.9.6, 12-Jan-1996
 - fixed bug: white spaces after boolean attributes have been
   stripped, if no expression followed
 - fixed bug: "click-here" checking has only been done, if RPLCENT
   has been set
 - MAJOR CHANGE: improved concept for attributes:
   - added tag <$DEFINE> to create new attributes
   - changed <$LET> to only update already existing
     attributes
   - changed syntax to define an attribute: flags
     now must come before default value; this
     stricter syntax seems to be more consistent, if
     you use a "/" in the default value, but didn't
     enclose it into quotes
   - added attribute flags /GLOBAL, /CONST, /GETSIZE
     and /STRIPEXT
   - removed attribute flags /NOQUOTE, /NOCOPY and
     /NOHANDLE (they've been undocumented anyway)
 - added COMPACT option to strip useless linefeeds and white spaces
 - added QUOTEMODE option to use same kind of quotes for all
   attributes
 - added STRIPEXTERNAL option to strip tags that contain a reference
   to an external URI
 - added STRIPCOMMENT to strip SGML comments
 - added STRIPTAGS to strip specific tags

 - added more subtile STATUS option
 - status message string is no more done via sprintf() and is
   stripped if it gets too long
 - added some plausibility checking for <$DEFENT>
 - rewrote ReadMe for example-project
 - fixed dead links in docs (used IGNORE=21 when converting docs..)

Version 0.9.5, 21-Dec-1995
 - included source into distribution
 - example project now compiles again (Hmpf..)
 - added boolean expressions
 - added default values for boolean attributes
 - added GETENV operator to import values of environment variables

Version 0.9.4, 14-Dec-1995
 - distributing archive under GNU General public license (read
   "GNU_GPL" for details)
 - renamed "hsc.html" to "index.html" (docs)
 - MAJOR CHANGE: introducing new concept for handling of arguments
   to attributes (see docs, chapter "Expressions"); references to
   other attributes MUST NOT be enclosed in "<" and ">" anymore.
 - added message for "click here" syndrome
 - added global attribute "__CLICK_HERE__" for keywords that should
   invoke a "click here" warning if found in anchor text.
 - added global attribute "__SYSTEM__", that contains an ID for the
   used operating system.
 - fixed bug: using an end tag for a non-container caused enforcer
   hit
 - fixed bug that lead to wrong file positions in error messages
   after some line-feeds
 - several minor bugs fixed

Version 0.9.3,  20-Nov-1995 (internal release only)
 - added special values for IGNORE
 - added PRE option for <$INCLUDE>
 - added <$SOURCE> to support inline sources
 - added tag <$LET> to create/update attributes
 - added tag <$MESSAGE> for user messages
 - container usage of <P> and <LI> is now supported (although, in a
   quite clumsy way; see AUTOCLOSE)
 - writes output only if no error occurred
 - improved handling of comments inside macros

   before processing it
 - fixed bug within nested <$ELSE>
 - fixed bug: <BASE> called handler for <Hx>
 - fixed bug: trailing white spaces of a file have not been processed
 - buffer for <$INSERT TIME> automatically expands to required size
   (before: limited to 40 chars)

Version 0.9.2, 23-Oct-1995
 - improved docs
 - changed concept for absolute URIs: switch ABSURI does no more
   exist, abs. URIs now start with ":" and can be mixed with
   relative URIs (suggested by Arno Hollosi)
 - <$IF>..<$ELSE>..</$IF> for conditional conversion
 - <$EXEC COMMAND=".."> to start shell commands
 - added SOURCE option for <$INCLUDE>
 - closing macro now not only inherits attributes passed to the
   opening macro, but also its values (kick me for that!)
 - check for redefinition of tag/macro

   white-spaces, comments and hsc-tags in config/include files)
 - removed bug in handler for SGML comments, if "\n" was found
   inside comment
 - Zero-SGML comments now work ( "<!>" only)
 - support JERK-attributes
 - more information displayed if unexpected end of file reached
 - removed enforcer-hit when writing to stdout
 - several minor bugs fixed
 - speed up for dynamic string handling
 - not compiled with gcc 2.6.3; compiled with a friend's sas/c
   because I got silly enforcer hits when compiling with gcc; even
   more strange, they only occure with Amiga-version of gcc;
   compiling hsc under Linux or FreeBSD (x86) causes no problems; I
   really should get gcc 2.7.0 for my Amiga..

Version 0.9.1,  9-Oct-1995
 - featuring "hsc.prefs"! (Gott, lass Hirn vom Himmel fallen)
 - improved docs (a bit)

   lines and white-spaces in config)
 - replaced <$INSERT TEXT STRING=".."> by <$INSERT TEXT="..">
 - improved handler for SGML comments (and "!"-tags)
 - support numeric entities (eg "&#123;")
 - "quot" entity
 - whines about quotes found within text
 - replace "&","<",">" by its entities, if surrounded by white spaces
   (switch SMARTENT)
 - replace quotes by "&quot;" (switch SMARTENT)
 - added "Reading config" status message
 - still compiled with gcc 2.6.3

Version 0.9,   4-Oct-1995 (first public release)
 - still compiled with gcc 2.6.3
